# NextStep
Objective

To create a user-friendly, front-end module that facilitates the assignment process for the NextStep platform. This system enables teachers to upload assignments and provides a mechanism for students to submit their work, all without the need for server-side processing.

Modules Implemented

1. Teacher Panel

Provides an interface for teachers to enter the assignment title and upload an associated file.

Dynamically adds and displays uploaded assignments on the page, making them immediately visible to students.

Uses a download button or similar UI element to allow students access to the assignment details.

2. Student Panel

Displays a list of assignments that have been uploaded by teachers.

Offers an interface for students to select an assignment and submit their respective responses, including file uploads.

Provides real-time feedback on submission status to improve user interaction.

Key Features

Dynamic DOM Manipulation:

JavaScript handles the dynamic addition of assignments and submission data, ensuring updates occur on the fly without requiring a page refresh.

Visual Feedback:

Users receive immediate confirmation of actions such as file uploads and assignment submissions, enhancing the overall user experience.

Clean and Responsive Design:

CSS is employed to create a clear, organized layout that distinguishes between teacher and student functionalities, ensuring ease of navigation.

Front-End Focus:

The system operates entirely on the front end, serving as a prototype. While it currently functions without server-side processing or database integration, it provides a strong foundation that can be scaled into a complete assignment management system with further backend integration.
